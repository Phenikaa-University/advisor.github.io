                        <p>Financial anxiety can — and does — affect us all.
                             Rising costs and changing market conditions cause anxiety for most people, 
                             especially parents and partners responsible for their households. Even with 
                             a secure income, the decisions around planning for your future can consume 
                             your thoughts and cloud your ability to be present, disrupting relationships, 
                             work, and rest.</p>

                            <p>When our advisors talk about practicing financial wellness, we’re talking 
                                about a meaningful component of living a healthy life — just like physical 
                                wellness or talk therapy. It’s an ongoing practice that requires consistent 
                                effort over time, not just in crisis, but the efforts pay off in dividends. 
                                Practicing financial wellness is rewarded with a clear mind,
                            and self-assurance that you’re doing the right thing for yourself and your family

                        <p>
                            Improving your life always requires some risk taking. 
                            We don’t mean jumping out of a plane or putting all your money on black. We’re 
                            talking about imagining a potential future for your life, and taking the steps toward it
                             — like switching careers, starting your own business, or moving across the country. An informed 
                             practice of financial wellness can help you better understand and evaluate risk, and help you build 
                             the safety net that minimizes your risk. Our advisors work to get to know your dreams and concerns, 
                            and work to help you navigate the present to achieve your future.

                            Financial wellness frees you from the “work till you die” mold. 
                            Travel the world. Take up a hobby. Spend more time with your kids. Good financial 
                            practices don’t necessarily constrict how you spend your money: They teach you how to save for 
                            what really matters most. That’s why we start with your goals, now and for the future, working 
                            backward to learn what you’ll need to achieve them. 
                            We believe financial wellness opens the door to a fuller, more satisfying life.

                    Despite all of the problems 
                    in the traditional financing advising industry, it still thrives for one reason: 
                    people want to connect with people. The internet, while convenient and a bottomless pit of information, 
                    can be a dark and lonely place wrought with diverging opinions. It’s hard to find the signal in the noise
                     and know what makes sense for you and your unique financial situation. New age financial planning and advising 
                     solutions often miss the mark as they remove people from the process entirely or find every way
                     possible to discourage you from getting on the phone with an actual professional.
                    </div>
    
            <div class="real-div-div">
                At Advisor we understand the necessity, and delight clients feel, in being able to connect with a real 
                human being. An advisor who can empathize with your problems and solution without constraints (no one size 
                fits all treatment). An advisor who remembers your name, your children’s names, and your dog’s name 
                (without you typing them into a form). And an Advisor who can hold you accountable to 
                achieving your wildest dreams (and not just through push notifications).
